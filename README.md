<h2 id="about">üí¨ About</h2>

This project was developed during the [NLW#14 Expert]() event offered by [Rocketseat](). The solution developed is a [simple](/// "very very simple") API of an auction system with the following features:

- Get data from open auctions;
- Perform an offer to a specific item in a specific auction;

My main goal to participate in the event was to start my contact with language and the development process with it.
